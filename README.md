This is a Python Script which monitors the Ethereum Price. 
You can set an alter price and you will get a discord notification as soon as the alert_price is lower than the current Ethereum price.
The data.json file is for configuration, fill in your details there.
Every time the the script monitors, it will get logged in the log.txt file with timestamp.
This is no Discord Bot!
